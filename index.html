    <h1>Prakriti's Component Library</h1>
    <p>I am following neog camp's coding classes and completing levelZero assignments daily.</p>
    <p>I am creating this component library to better design each element.</p>
    <p>After creating this library I am going to use the components in my <b>portfolio, blog and all projects</b> 
        created. This will ensure that all my projects have a <b>consistent theming and styling</b>.</p>
